# Pre-Shared Vertices

In order to set up [Collaboration Spaces](https://github.com/fsteff/certacrypt/blob/master/docs/multiwriter.md) or [Private Communication Channels](https://github.com/fsteff/certacrypt/blob/master/docs/private-commchannel.md) between users that don't have an active communication channel yet, Pre-Shared Vertices are a mechanism that allows creating a private edge between two graphs.

For more details on the initial key exchange and the motivation see [Inbox](https://github.com/fsteff/certacrypt/blob/master/docs/inbox.md).
